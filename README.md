# Grading_fruits_image_processing
In this project, Fruits were graded according to their size, colour and ripness

:The developing system grades the fruit based on ripeness, size and
defects.
: Canny edge detection technique is using for detecting the defects on
the fruits.
: Total soluble solid (TSS) and RGB components of the image is using for
measuring the ripeness of the system.
: Size of the fruit is being determined by calculating the pixel area.
